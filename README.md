# Virtual Memmory Manager

A Virtual Memory Manager project is essential for enhancing system performance, resource 
management, and providing a convenient and secure abstraction of memory for applications 
running in a computer system. It plays a vital role in ensuring that multiple processes can run 
concurrently while effectively utilizing the available hardware resources.



## FIFO
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a simple and straightforward page replacement algorithm that is 
sometimes used in address translation, particularly for managing the contents of the TLB 
(Translation Lookaside Buffer). FIFO is not used for address translation itself but rather for 
deciding which entry in the TLB should be replaced when a new entry needs to be added due to 
a TLB miss.
